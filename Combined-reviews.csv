So manny incredible achievements in and out of the ring. He’s been brutally stopped once and been in so many wars and his mind seems sharper now than what it was when he first started when most fighters would’ve been a lil punchy, but he could be the Philippines next president. Pacman is a real life super hero; what an amazing true story.",11

Ed Rock,1 week ago,Thank Goodness that he never got in the ring with Spence it would have been all bad for Pacquiao. Pacquiao’s legacy was done after his loss to Floyd Mayweather that was and will always be his legacy fight. He was billed as the fighter of the decade in the fight of the century against Floyd. Arum built Pacquiao’s career on his alleged abilities to beat Floyd. Arum and Roach blocked the fight from happening for the feeble reason of drug testing. 2012 Floyd offered Pacquiao 40Million! Arum and Koncz said no! Why? To milk and rob Pacquiao some more fighting trilogies and one Juan Manuel Marquez in 2012 for the Fourth time resulting in a devastating KO! That was essentially the end of his career! Yet the Floyd fight happened n 2015 and Pacquiao was made to look amateurish and unskilled against a masterclass boxer! That is the real story that Pacquiao was never in the class of Floyd! If Floyd got to fight him instead of JMM he would of beat him in 2009. Ending 6 years of hype and BS about Floyd being scared and ducking Pacquiao! Conveniently Pacquiao fights Thurman and eek’s out a close split decision against Keith Thurman and Pacquiao is deemed better than Floyd who is retired doing exhibitions for 100million. He is battered so badly in that fight with Thurman he took two year’s from boxing 🥊 He still needs money so he is taking another fight to try and change his legacy against Spence! Thankfully that never occurred and Yordenis Ugas beats Pacquiao easily.,1

Jei Mairuzu,3 days ago,"Pacquiao is the last fighter from his era in the 90's to early 2000. All of the big names from his era has been retired for quite awhile now.

Barrera, Morales, Marquez, Cotto, Mosley, Dela Hoya, Margarito and the list goes on. There is no better way of retiring an era like what Manny did. If there's no politics involved, he would still fight. Unfortunately, politics caught up on him and made it more his responsibility than boxing. Hopefully if Manny failed to be elected he can come out of retirement and fight one more time and hopefully win to seal the deal and retire for good. That would be a good show for the whole world.",1

He's the only man who has a lot of excuses. Out of all the boxers who fought Manny in his career he's the only drama queen and that's also a fact.

Mayweather didn't hurt Pacquiao and didn't have plans to get hurt. He kept backing up and and when Pac is pushing towards him to hurt him he would hug. That's how Floyd as a boxer. He isn't an aggressor type unlike Manny he would attack you in different angles as hard as he could 'cause he's a Warrior. He's not afraid to get hurt. Pacquiao - Warrior. Mayweather - Defensive Specialist. If you ask who am i going to choose. I would go for Manny. Zero doesn't count but what you have shown and the records that you did something that in this generation could not do anymore. He's one in a Billion.,

Great Career and Still The 🐐🐐🐐GreatestOfAllTime
Hall Of Famer and All Time Greats
    Thank you Senator Manny Pacman Pacquiao for giving your best even though your both legs are in severe pain and badly cramping from the second round during the fight because of over training before the fight (You Tube videos showing his coaches asking Manny Pacquiao to already stop training), he was running daily in the mountain and even perform sparring for 32 rounds per day; but he was enjoying too much training hard and over extends himself even to the very last day before the fight. That made him to have painful cramps on both legs that started in the second round which made him move slow and was unable to move in and out, execute properly his strategies, techniques, combinations and fight plans. If you watch the fight live then you can hear Senator Manny Pacquiao saying “naninigas ang binti at hita ko!”/“both my legs are stiff and cramping!” in the corner after the 3rd round.🥊🇵🇭",

Ernest Gago,1 month ago,"I love how the narrative is always been about how Manny this and manny that as far as excuses. Barely I’ve seen or heard about people giving due credit to Ugas. 

Now with that being said if that were Spence, then all these excuses all these so called “experts” are making would be totally different. Namely, not taking away from Spence’s victory but adding how it was expected and that Manny is one of the greatest (which he is) all this and that. However, the truth is different. Therefore all this rain of excuses keeps on going and tarnishing Ugas victory. ",

KDNS,1 month ago,"Believe me, I understand what everybody is saying but there HAS to be something said about the fact that he took this fight with 12 days anticipation. Is manny too old to beat a guy? or to just too old to fight on a 12 day game plan against a quality fighter? (especially considering his age, which I think plays more of a factor in this scenario)",

Shy B,1 month ago,"This is bullshit man. Pacquiao isn’t washed smh. Like they said he was put in the ring with a fighter that was bigger, and i wouldn’t say more skilled, but Ugas definitely had an advantage cuz he got the fight 2 weeks be4 and Pacquiao the whole time was training for Spence. Not a bigger boxer like Ugas. I guarantee if Pacquiao fought Spence the outcome would’ve been different. Not saying he would’ve won, but he would’ve never got beat the way he did Saturday night.",

that would be the walk off of all walk offs in the history of sports.

photographerjonathan,1 month ago,"I think there is something wrong with the rules of boxing. a fighter who is a middle weight can lose allot weight for the weigh in and then gain 20 pounds before the fight. Ugas should not be in the same weight class as Pacquaio. and neither should Spence. the size difference was crazy, its not fair for a 42 year old fighter to have to fight a guy with arms that are twice the size of Manny and six inches longer. but I think Manny should not of lined up a fight with Spence in the first place.",1

elijah tijerina,1 month ago,Manny just wasn’t prepared right for ugas. He took the fight with an 11 day notice after training months for Spence. He could’ve beat him if he would trained right for ugas just like he did when he fought Antonio margarito. Much bigger and stronger. Yes manny was younger and faster but he had the proper training,

Marvin M. McIntyre,1 month ago (edited),Pac has never been a great defender. He just got out boxed by a more technical sound boxer. He would have lost to Ugas quite a few years ago to.
